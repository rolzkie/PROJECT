I don’t think I’ll ever fully find the right words for how grateful I am for you, but I want to try.

We started so far apart, miles between us, screens instead of hands, and somehow you still made me feel closer than anyone ever has. You stayed. You chose me. Even when I messed up, even when I was dumb, even when I didn’t always know how to say things right—you never walked away. That means more to me than you probably realize.

Thank you for loving me the way you do. Thank you for your patience, your kindness, and for believing in me when I don’t always believe in myself. I know I’m not perfect, but I promise you this: my love for you is real, deep, and growing every day.

I can’t wait for the day when distance is just something we laugh about, when I get to hold you instead of missing you. Until then, I’ll keep choosing you, just like you’ve chosen me.

I’m so thankful for you. I’m so thankful for us.
And I hope this is just the beginning of something really beautiful.</strong> Meo
